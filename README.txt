== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why isn't the widget displayed in my sidebar? =
In order to display the widget, you need to assign it to the sidebar in the Shop page, and you also need to add Product Attributes to your product. Read the Getting Started section to learn how to add them.

= Translation issue with the latest version =
Dear users,
we would like to inform you that the YITH WooCommerce Ajax Navigation plugin will change its name in YITH WooCommerce Ajax Product Filter from the next update.
In addition to the name, with the new release the plugin textdomain will change too from "yit" to "yith_wc_ajxnav".
This modification solves the issues about textdomain conflicts generated by some translation/multilanguage plugins you have identified in the past weeks.
It may be possible that, updating the plugin, some language files will not be recognized by WordPress. In this case, you will just have to rename the language files in the correct format, changing the old textdomain with the new one.
For example, if your language files were named yit-en_GB.po and yit-en_GB.mo, you will just have to rename them respectively in yith_wc_ajxnav-en_GB.po and yith_wc_ajxnav-en_GB.mo.
After renaming the files, you can update/translate the .po file following the classic procedure for translations.
