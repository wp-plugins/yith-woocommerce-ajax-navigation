== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why isn't the widget displayed in my sidebar? =
In order to display the widget, you need to assign it to the sidebar in the Shop page and you also need to add WooCommerce Product Attributes to your product. Read the "Getting Started" section of the documentation to learn how to add them.

= Translation issue with the version 2.0.0 =
Dear users,
we would like to inform you that the plugin YITH WooCommerce Ajax Navigation will change its name into YITH WooCommerce Ajax Product Filter from the next update.
In addition to the name, with the new release the plugin, textdomain will change too from "yit" to "yith_wc_ajxnav".
This change solves issues concerning textdomain conflicts generated by some translation/multilanguage plugins you have identified in the past weeks.
It may be possible that, with the plugin update, some language files will not be recognized by WordPress. In this case, you will just have to rename the language files with the correct format, changing the old textdomain with the new one.
For example, if your language files were named yit-en_GB.po and yit-en_GB.mo, you will just have to rename them respectively as yith_wc_ajxnav-en_GB.po and yith_wc_ajxnav-en_GB.mo.
After renaming the files, you can update/translate the .po file following the classic procedure for translations.

= What are the main changes in plugin translation? =
= Translation issue with the version 2.4.0 =
Recently YITH WooCommerce Ajax Product Filter has been selected to be included in the "translate.wordpress.org" translate programme. In order to import correctly the plugin strings in the new system, we had to change the text domain form 'yith_wc_ajxnav' to 'yith-woocommerce-ajax-navigation'. Once the plugin will be imported in the translate.wordpress.org system, the translations of other languages will be downloaded directly from WordPress, without using any .po and .mo files. Moreover, users will be able to participate in a more direct way to plugin translations, suggesting texts in their languages in the dedicated tab on translate.wordpress.org. During this transition step, .po and .mo files will be used as always, but in order to be recognized by WordPress, they will need to have a new nomenclature, renaming them in: yith-woocommerce-ajax-navigation-.po yith-woocommerce-ajax-navigation-.mo. For example, if your language files were named yit-en_GB.po and yit-en_GB.mo, you will just have to rename them respectively as yith-woocommerce-ajax-navigation-en_GB.po and yith-woocommerce-ajax-navigation-en_GB.mo.

= The widget with WooCommerce filters is not working =
= The page doesn't update after clicking on a WooCommerce filter =

The issue could be related to the fact you are using a non-standard template for a WooCommerce shop page. To solve it, you should ask to the theme's author to use WooCommerce standard HTML classes. 
As an alternative:
**For version prior to 2.2.0:** 

you can use this piece of code in functions.php file of your theme:

`
if( ! function_exists( 'yith_wcan_frontend_classes' ) ){
	 function yith_wcan_frontend_classes(){
	  return array(
	            'container'    => 'YOUR_SHOP_CONTAINER',
	            'pagination'   => 'YOUR_PAGINATION_CONTAINER',
	            'result_count' => 'YOUR_RESULT_COUNT_CONTAINER'

	        ); 
	 }
}

add_filter( 'yith_wcan_ajax_frontend_classes', 'yith_wcan_frontend_classes' );
`

If you don't know which classes you should use, ask to the developer of your theme.

**From version 2.3.0 or later:**

You don't have to write manually the code anymore, as you can just go to YITH Plugin -> Ajax Product Filter -> Front End and set easily the parameters from the text fields.

If you don't know which classes you should use, ask to the developer of your theme.

= PAAMAYIM NEKUDOTAYIM Error after update 2.1.0 =

After the update 2.1.0, some users of YITH WooCommerce Ajax Product Filter are experiencing the error: "Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM". This is caused by the PHP version of your server that is older than the 5.3. To solve the issue, you just have to update the plugin to the version 2.1.1.

= Is it compatible with all WordPress themes? =

Compatibility with all themes is impossible, because they are too many, but generally if themes are developed according to WordPress and WooCommerce guidelines, YITH plugins are compatible with them.
Yet, we can grant compatibility with themes developed by YIThemes, because they are constantly updated and tested with our plugins. Sometimes, especially when new versions are released, it might only require some time for them to be all updated, but you can be sure that they will be tested and will be working in a few days. 


= How can I get support if my WooCommerce plugin is not working? =

If you have problems with our WooCommerce plugins or something is not working as it should, first follow this preliminary steps:

* Test the plugin with a WordPress default theme, to be sure that the error is not caused by the theme you are currently using.
* Deactivate all plugins you are using and check if the problem is still occurring.
* Ensure that you plugin version, your theme version and your WordPress and WooCommerce version (if required) are updated and that the problem you are experiencing has not already been solved in a later plugin update.

If none of the previous listed actions helps you solve the problem, then, submit a ticket in the forum and describe your problem accurately, specify WordPress and WooCommerce versions you are using and any other information that might help us solve your problem as quickly as possible. Thanks! 


= How can I get more features for my WooCommerce plugin? =

You can get more features with the premium version of YITH WooCommerce Ajax Product Filter, available on [YIThemes page]( https://yithemes.com/themes/plugins/yith-woocommerce-ajax-product-filter/). Here you can read more about the premium features of the plugin and make it give it its best shot!


= How can I try the full-featured plugin? =

If you want to see a demonstration version of the premium plugin, you can see it installed on two different WooCommerce sites, either in [this page]( http://plugins.yithemes.com/yith-woocommerce-ajax-product-filter/?preview) or in [this page](http://preview.yithemes.com/bazar/shop/).
